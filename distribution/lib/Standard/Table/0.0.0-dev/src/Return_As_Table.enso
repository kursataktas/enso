type Return_As_Table
    ## Returns a table with a new column `Value` containing the objects loaded
       from each file.

       When the source for files to load was a table, all columns from the
       original table are also retained. In case of name clashes, the newly
       added columns will get a suffix.

       When the source was a simple Vector, the returned table will also contain
       a `File Name` column.
    Table_Of_Objects

    ## All files are interpreted as tables and then merged into a single table
       by a union operation.

       Each file is loaded according to the provided/detected format. If the
       format reads it as something else than a table, then it is expanded in
       the same way as `Table.from_objects`.
